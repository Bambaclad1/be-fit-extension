# be-fit push-up interval timer
A free open-source browser extension that reminds everyone staring at a screen to stay fit and drop 20.

Why? Because we should care about our health. Studies show that sitting too much weakens your joints, muscles, and overall energy. The least you can do is drop some push-ups and eventually, add stretching and mini workouts into your daily grind.

Current progress: Design, come look!

## Why did i make this?
I made this because most people are busy with work on their screens for 8 hours long. I wanted to create something that **forces you to move**, even for 30 seconds, reminding you that **discipline starts with small action**. Push-ups are just the start of building a habit.
